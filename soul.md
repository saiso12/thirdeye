> The philosophy and principles that guide this personal operating system.

## What is thirdeye?

thirdeye is a personal operating system built on Obsidian + Claude Code. It's not just a note-taking system—it's a cognitive extension that helps you think, reflect, and evolve.

## Core Principles

### 1. Capture Without Friction
Ideas are fleeting. The system should never get in the way of capturing a thought. Minimal prompts, maximum speed.

### 2. Cascading Reflection
Daily observations roll into weekly insights, which form monthly patterns, which shape quarterly direction, which align with yearly vision. Nothing is lost; everything compounds.

### 3. The System Serves You
You don't serve the system. If a workflow feels like overhead, it's a bug in the OS, not a failure of discipline. Iterate.

### 4. Emergence Over Structure
Don't over-organize upfront. Let connections emerge through use. The best structures reveal themselves through practice.

### 5. Human + AI Partnership
Claude isn't a replacement for thinking—it's an amplifier. The OS enhances your cognition while preserving your agency and voice.

## The Three Layers

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│         SOUL (Why)              │  ← Philosophy, principles, purpose
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│         OS (How)                │  ← Skills, templates, workflows
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│         DATA (What)             │  ← Notes, projects, ideas, reviews
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Soul**: The unchanging principles that guide decisions
- **OS**: The versioned system that evolves with your needs
- **Data**: Your personal content that grows over time

## Design Philosophy

### Minimal Viable Process
Every workflow should have the minimum steps needed. If you can remove a step without losing value, remove it.

### Progressive Disclosure
Simple by default, powerful when needed. Skills should work with zero config but support deep customization.

### Observable System
You should be able to see how the OS is working. What skills are active? What patterns are emerging? The system should be introspectable.

### Graceful Evolution
The OS should evolve without breaking your existing data. Backwards compatibility matters. Migration paths should be clear.

## The Promise

thirdeye promises to:
- **Reduce cognitive load**, not add to it
- **Surface insights** you might have missed
- **Preserve your voice** in everything it helps create
- **Grow with you** as your needs change
- **Stay out of your way** when you're in flow

## Version Philosophy

- **Patch (0.0.x)**: Bug fixes, minor tweaks
- **Minor (0.x.0)**: New skills, templates, non-breaking improvements
- **Major (x.0.0)**: Breaking changes, major paradigm shifts
